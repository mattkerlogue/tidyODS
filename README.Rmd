`{tidyods}` is an R package to import cells from an OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) 
file, and provide information about the cell's postion, value types and formulas,
and provide methods to "rectify" cells back to a 2-dimensional data.frame.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{tidyods}` like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("mattkerlogue/tidyods")
```

## Usage
The `{tidyods}` package exports the following functions for users:

- `read_ods_cells(path, sheet)`: extract the cells from a sheet in an ODS file
- `read_ods_sheet(path, sheet, rectify = "simple", base_values = TRUE)`: extract 
  cells from an ODS sheet and return as a rectangular dataset, like a spreadsheet
- `ods_sheets(path)`: list the sheets in an ODS fie
- `simple_rectify(path)`: "rectify" a set of cells into a rectangular dataset, 
  like a spreadsheet

## Performance
An ODS file is a zipped collection of XML files and associated files. 
This package, like the  `{readODS}` package uses the [xml2](https://xml2.r-lib.org) package to process this file. There are three likely sources of performance 
issues: downloading of remote files, unzipping the ODS file, processing rows.

Performance is slower than `{readODS}`, however `{tidyods}` provides console 
messages and progress bars to the user. If performance is a major determinant of
your workflow (i.e. you have very large files), its likely more sensible to open
the file in a spreadsheet application and save the file as an XLSX file and using
tidyxl.

## Related projects
The `{tidyODS}` package is heavily inspired by two existing packages:

- The [`{readODS}`](https://github.com/chainsawriot/readODS) package provides
  functionality to read and write ODS files with R, with the resulting data.frame
  reflecting the way the data is viewed in a spreadsheet editor application (i.e
  a two-dimension table structure).
- The [`{tidyxl}`](https://nacnudus.github.io/tidyxl/) package reads cells from Excel
  files and provides a data.frame where each cell is its own row and columns 
  provide information about the cell's location, value and value type, formula and
  formatting.
- The [`{unpivotr}`](https://nacnudus.github.io/unpivotr/) package works with 
  datasets of cells (such as those created by tidyxl).

## Philosophy
The `{readODS}` package is the only package on CRAN that handles the reading of ODS
files, whereas there are more than 20 packages (as at 12 June 2022) on CRAN that
work with Excel files (of which `{tidyxl}` is one). In some respects this is due to
the wider usage of Excel files by businesses, governments, academia and other
organisations to publish and share data. Various governments and international
organisations are starting to mandate the use of OpenDocument Format files for
publishing of their information.

The initial purpose of `{tidyods}` was to provide a second package to the R ecosystem
for reading ODS files, in part prompted when encountering an error with `{readODS}` 
and discovering no alternative pacakge was available. For example if you run 
into an error when using the `{readxl}` package you could use easily try the 
`{openxlsx}` or `{xlsx}` instead.

The conceptual code development lead to the creation of an output dataset 
similar to that produced by the `{tidyxl}` package.

Thus, `{tidyods}` extracts cells from an ODS document in the same manner as
`{tidyxl}`, but includes functions to "rectify" the cells so as to also provide
an output similar to that of `{readODS}` (and many of those that read Excel 
files). This is similar to the 
[rectify](https://nacnudus.github.io/unpivotr/reference/rectify.html) function 
in the `{unpivotr}` package.
