`{tidyods}` imports cells from an OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) file, and 
provides not just the cell's value but also information about the cell's
position, value types and formulas in a tidy format to allow further
programmatic analysis, investigation and manipulation. It also provides methods
to "rectify" cells back to a 2-dimensional data.frame.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{tidyods}` like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("mattkerlogue/tidyods")
```

## Usage

You can read in cells via the `read_ods_cells()` function. There is a helper
function `ods_sheets()` that can list the sheets in an ODS file.

The package includes an example ODS with two sheets: `penguins` and `types`.

```{r}
library(tidyods)

example_file <- system.file("extdata", "basic_example.ods", package = "tidyods")

ods_sheets(example_file)

read_ods_cells(example_file, sheet = "penguins", quiet = TRUE)
```

The `penguins` sheet is a simple 6 rows by 4 columns sheet that stores the 
output of the following code:

```{r}
palmerpenguins::penguins |>
  tidyr::drop_na() |>
  dplyr::group_by(species, female = sex == "female") |>
  dplyr::summarise(
    dplyr::across(c(bill_length_mm, body_mass_g), ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```


There are functions to "rectify" a `{tidyods}` data.frame back to a traditional
2-dimensional array, the function `read_ods_sheet()` combines `read_ods_cells()`
and the rectify functions to easily import a dataset.

```{r}
#| message: false
penguin_sheet <- read_ods_sheet(example_file, "penguins", quick = TRUE, quiet = TRUE)

penguin_sheet
```


The `types` sheet shows examples of the different ODS data types:
```{r}
#| message: false
types_cells <- read_ods_cells(example_file, "types", quiet = TRUE)

types_cells |> 
  dplyr::filter(row > 1) |>
  dplyr::group_by(col) |>
  dplyr::glimpse()

types_cells |>
  dplyr::filter(row > 1) |>
  dplyr::group_by(col) |>
  dplyr::slice_head(n = 2) |>
  dplyr::select(-cell_type)
```

## Performance

An ODS file is a zipped collection of XML files and associated files. 
`{tidyods}`, like the `{readODS}` package, uses the [`{xml2}`](https://xml2.r-lib.org) 
package to process this file. There are three likely sources of performance 
issues: downloading of remote files, unzipping the ODS file, processing rows.

Performance of `read_ods_cells()` and `read_ods_sheet()` is largely comparable
to that provided by `{readODS}`. Performance can be improved by setting 
`quick = TRUE`, which extracts only the .


```{r}
#| message: false
types_cells_quick <- read_ods_cells(example_file, "types",
                                    quick = TRUE, quiet = TRUE)

types_cells_quick |>
  dplyr::filter(row > 1) |>
  dplyr::group_by(col) |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

```r
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  tidy_quick = read_ods_cells(example_file, 1, quick = TRUE, quiet = TRUE),
  tidy_slow = read_ods_cells(example_file, 1, quiet = TRUE),
  tidy_sheet_quick = read_ods_sheet(example_file, 1, quick = TRUE, quiet = TRUE),
  tidy_sheet_slow = read_ods_sheet(example_file, 1, col_headers = FALSE, quiet = TRUE),
  read_ods = readODS::read_ods(example_file, 1),
  times = 100
)

#> Unit: milliseconds
#>              expr    min     lq   mean median     uq    max neval
#>        tidy_quick 15.232 15.471 17.184 15.756 19.634 24.963   100
#>         tidy_slow 28.351 28.964 32.354 32.619 33.129 93.572   100
#>  tidy_sheet_quick 20.235 20.714 22.607 20.949 24.923 33.244   100
#>   tidy_sheet_slow 33.687 37.592 38.502 38.236 38.654 83.943   100
#>          read_ods 22.087 22.490 24.853 22.696 26.275 86.275   100
```

To test real-world performance we will use an ODS file published by the UK 
Government on the [number of civil servants by postcode](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/number-of-civil-servants-by-postcode-department-responsibility-level-and-leaving-cause-2021), a sheet of 5,544 rows by 11 columns.

```r
postcodes_file <- system.file("extdata", "civil-service-postcodes-2021.ods",
  package = "tidyods")

microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  tidy_quick = read_ods_cells(postcodes_file, 2, quick = TRUE, quiet = TRUE),
  tidy_slow = read_ods_cells(postcodes_file, 2, quiet = TRUE),
  tidy_sheet_quick = read_ods_sheet(postcodes_file, 2, quick = TRUE, quiet = TRUE),
  tidy_sheet_slow = read_ods_sheet(postcodes_file, 2, col_headers = FALSE, quiet = TRUE),
  read_ods = readODS::read_ods(postcodes_file, 2),
  times = 10
)

#> Unit: seconds
#>             expr    min     lq   mean median     uq    max neval
#>       tidy_quick  4.003  4.055  4.129  4.088  4.193  4.341    10
#>        tidy_slow 10.453 10.497 10.592 10.559 10.636 10.992    10
#> tidy_sheet_quick  4.096  4.125  4.232  4.170  4.260  4.660    10
#>  tidy_sheet_slow 10.679 10.786 10.983 10.908 11.158 11.669    10
#>         read_ods 10.552 10.757 10.877 10.801 10.971 11.493    10
```

The dependency on `{xml2}` is likely to cause the function to fail/crash when
working with exceptionally large files.

Performance issues are tracked and discussed in 
[issue #3](https://github.com/mattkerlogue/tidyods/issues/3) 
in the package's GitHub repository.

## Related projects

The `{tidyODS}` package is heavily inspired by three existing packages:

- The [`{readODS}`](https://github.com/chainsawriot/readODS) package provides
  functionality to read and write ODS files with R, with the resulting 
  data.frame reflecting the way the data is viewed in a spreadsheet editor 
  application (i.e a two-dimension table structure).
- The [`{tidyxl}`](https://nacnudus.github.io/tidyxl/) package reads cells from 
  Excel files and provides a data.frame where each cell is its own row and 
  columns provide information about the cell's location, value and value type, 
  formula and formatting.
- The [`{unpivotr}`](https://nacnudus.github.io/unpivotr/) package works with 
  datasets of cells (such as those created by tidyxl).

## Philosophy

The `{readODS}` package is the only package on CRAN that handles the reading of 
ODS files, whereas there are more than 20 packages (as at 12 June 2022) on CRAN 
that work with Excel files (of which `{tidyxl}` is one). In some respects this 
is due to the wider usage of Excel files by businesses, governments, academia 
and other organisations to publish and share data. Various governments and
international organisations are starting to mandate the use of OpenDocument 
Format files for publishing of their information.

The initial purpose of `{tidyods}` was to provide a second package to the R 
ecosystem for reading ODS files, in part prompted when encountering an error 
with `{readODS}` and discovering no alternative package was available. This is
not the same when working with Excel spreadsheets, for example if you run into
an error when using the `{readxl}` package you could  use easily try the 
`{openxlsx}` or `{xlsx}` packages instead.

The initial conceptual development of code lead to the creation of an output
dataset  similar to that produced by the `{tidyxl}` package. Thus, `{tidyods}`
extracts cells from an ODS document in the same manner as `{tidyxl}`, but
includes functions to "rectify" the cells so as to also provide
an output similar to that of `{readODS}` (and many of those that read Excel 
files). This is similar to the 
[rectify](https://nacnudus.github.io/unpivotr/reference/rectify.html) function 
in the `{unpivotr}` package.
